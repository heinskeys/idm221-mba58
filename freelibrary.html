            <h2>i. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Over the course of two terms, we were tasked with completely redesigning a website of our choosing. With instructor guidance, we developed interactive high-fidelity prototypes for a fully responsive website. For my project, I decided to focus on the Free Library of Philadelphia, the largest public library in the city. </p>
            <h2>ii. Design Process</h2>
            <h3>Identifying Our User Demographic</h3>
            <p> 
                When I was initially researching my target demographic, I came across two potential audiences: book-social-media users (teens - early 20’s ; booktwt, booktok) and adults using the library as a resource for them and their children. Whereas book-social-media users were more likely to scarcely use the website's broader features, as they were mainly focused on getting a library card, keeping up with new releases the library has, and any potential signings with popular authors — adults using the site as a resource seemed to be who the site was marketed towards. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These adults tend to trend older than book-social-media users. They are more likely to have kids and would like to more greatly engage with the library's different events, programs, and services. They are also looking to keep up to date with new releases but will rely more heavily on the events' features. As such, I crafted my user persona to be more focused on this lens, (while still keeping in mind how the site could suit both these userbases). 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Developed Persona
            </h3>
            <p>
                Elizabeth Banner is an aspiring author seeking community. She is especially tuned into library events and services like writer’s workshops, industry talks, and other potential resources she could use to help further her career. She is a Digital Native, she knows how to use technology, and as such, prefers cleaner, sleeker, more streamlined websites that allow integrations and/or prioritize efficiency. Elizabeth wants to keep up to date with the latest releases as well as further educate herself. 
            </p>
            <h3>Market and User Research</h3>
            <p>After identifying my user base I sought to better understand the site's core issues, both in relation to other peer websites on the market and from the user base's perspective. In this process, I narrowed down three major issues I thought the site faced:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="plist">Outdated Design</li>
                <p>The outdated design, while a trend with most public library systems, disadvantages them in regards to their target audience. Most users of the site — and as such within the target demographic — will have a preference for cleaner, modern designs as digital natives. </p>
                <p>
                It also puts them behind other MAJOR public library systems of their caliber, such as the New York Public Library which has a sleeker UI. A target user may be more inclined to explore other PA branches or even library systems outside of PA that offer out-of-state users opportunities (as well as commercial platforms). 
                </p>
                <li class="plist">Feature Clutter</li>
                <p>
                The FLoP website suffers from a significant amount of clutter. This is something present in the design but also in the organizational structure of the website itself. Users have so many options, many of which are presented at them all at once. </p>

                <p>For example, the blog page has a word cloud and a tag system attached that acts as a another content search method. However, the word cloud is largely useless and serves no real function and there are far too many tags for the feature to be useful. </p>

                <p>This is something we notice across the site, with there being lots of options present but many of which don't actually serve the user (i.e make things easier or simplified).</p>

                <p>This is also in contrast to other public library systems websites, like the NYPL, which has a much more streamlined approach.

                <p>Considering the target demographic is made up of digital natives, this excess of choice is likely to turn off the user as they are far more used to and inclined to use more organized websites. It also discourages users from exploring the site more, as well as actually looking into things they may be interested in since much of this information is buried behind tags, categories, and/or hidden in other pages. 

                <p>It would take Elizabeth, for example, significantly more work than necessary just to find a writer's workshop.
                </p>
                <li class="plist">Lack Of Visual Hierarchy</li>
                <p>Unlike most websites, the Free Library of Philadelphia does not arrange its content in order of importance or to draw attention to important/special features. Instead, the homepage, and subsequent pages, follow an inconsistent layout and design. Heading size, content layout, color palette, font color (etc) all range heavily depending on which area of the site you are on. 

                <p>The homepage is a prime example of this, with the content being placed all around the page, in varying styles, instead of section by section (or, more popularly, linearly). 

                <p>This is disadvantageous to both the user and the library. The target audience is less likely to be able to find the specific resources they are looking for, while the Library isn’t properly highlighting the resources/events/programs they intended to. 

                <p>And tailored my goals towards solving these issues in order to better serve the intended user base and highlight library services. 
                </p>
            </ol>
            <h3>Site Map and Visual Identity Development 
            </h3>
            <p>With that in mind, I began to develop the site and its new identity. I wanted to emphasize a minimalist design, more in line with its peers, while also focusing on pushing forward my goals. 

            <p>I also began developing wireframes that reflected the developed identity. 

            <p>In this process, I underwent a round of user testing and feedback that pushed me to continue to reiterate upon the aesthetics of the to improve look and flow, reinforcing the established identity. 
            </p>
