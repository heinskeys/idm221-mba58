        <p>As a graphic designer for Drexelâ€™s Campus Activities Board, the largest student-run organization on campus, I develop branding and graphics for our events across various social media platforms. </p>
        <h2>Murder Mystery, October 2023</h2>
        <p>Developed for a Murder Mystery event with a focus on inmates being used in the cure for the zombie apocalypse. I wanted to invoke the aesthetic of old hidden documents, like the viewer is uncovering secrets past! I took inspiration from police documents and old anatomy diaries.</p>
        <h2>Halloween Nights @ Eastern State, October 2023</h2>
        <p>Developed for a CAB-sponsored Eastern State Halloween night trip! For this poster, I wanted to emphasize the type more than anything, taking inspiration from graphic t-shirts. </p>
        <h2>Six Flags Fright Fest, September 2023</h2>
        <p>Developed for a CAB-sponsored Six Flags Fright Fest trip! For this poster, I focused on trying to strike a balance between representing horror and rollercoasters. In my research both of the event and for inspiration, I made note of the lack of graphical attempts to combine the fun thrill of riding a rollercoaster with the added horror elements. I needed it to not just be a horror poster or a Six Flags poster, but something that struck the balance in between. I also wanted to play around with flatter, non-colored graphic styles. </p>
        <h2>Flyers V. Devils, September 2023</h2>
        <p>Developed for a CAB-sponsored Flyers v Devils trip! While this event was canceled, I still enjoy the work conceptually! I wanted to really hone in on emulating the various interesting styles of sports graphics, particularly for the NBA while also leaning into a comic book aesthetic. </p>
