    <h1>Hello!-</h1>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by! I’m Mack, a User Experience & Interaction Design student who wants to connect people through interactive storytelling.

    When I’m not designing, you can find me playing video games, debating the best Wordle opener, and obsessing over NYT Interactives.
        
    If any of those things interest you, feel free to reach out to me!</p>
