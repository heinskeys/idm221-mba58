        <h2>i. Introduction </h2>
        <p>Over the course of one term we were tasked with redesigning an app with a focus on improving the user's experience through micro-interactions. With instructor guidance, we rebranded, sketched, and developed a prototype user flow with unique interactions. </p>
        <p>I chose to redesign the android app Loop: Habit Tracker. </p>
        <h2>ii. Design Process </h2>
        <h3>Market Research and Rebranding</h3>
        <p>I began first researching other popular habit tracker apps within the Google Play store. I wanted to see where Loop stood in comparison but I also wanted to see where users were finding issues with these apps as well. From this, I was able to develop a user persona: </p>
        <p>With this user in mind, I began rebranding the app and developing a new interface that would address his pain points. </p>
        <h3>Developing Microinteractions</h3>
        <p>While the design, flow, and intended user base were important factors in this project, our primary focus was the creation and implementation of various micro-interactions throughout the app. How can we develop, iterate upon, and display our ideas? What interactions would bring the most user joy without causing frustration over time? Using my user persona, I drafted several microinteraction sketches that i thought could improve upon his pain points. </p>
        <p>From there I developed an interaction flow, expounding upon these interactions and their greater function within the app.</p>
        <p>I took these concepts into After Effects, where I began to animate out the user flow. </p>
        <h2>iii. Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Overall, I am happy with the micro-interactions themselves! I enjoyed the process of focusing specifically on this one aspect of design, as I have a vested interested in the little ways we can change a user's experience. Even just one small interaction can totally shift a user's perspective and Iâ€™d love to explore that more in future projects. I think my redesign of the app itself could definitely be improved upon, I think it leans a bit too far in the minimalist direction but I enjoy the result nonetheless. </p>
