### free library of philadelphia redesign 
Timeline: 2 Terms

Skills: Interface Design, User Testing 

#### i. Introduction 

Over the course of two terms, we were tasked with completely redesigning a website of our choosing. With instructor guidance, we developed interactive high-fidelity prototypes for a fully responsive website. 

For my project, I decided to focus on the Free Library of Philadelphia, the largest public library in the city. 

#### ii. Design Process

*Identifying Our User Demographic*

When I was initially researching my target demographic, I came across two potential audiences: book-social-media users (teens - early 20’s ; booktwt, booktok) and adults using the library as a resource for them and their children. Whereas book-social-media users were more likely to scarcely use the website's broader features, as they were mainly focused on getting a library card, keeping up with new releases the library has, and any potential signings with popular authors — adults using the site as a resource seemed to be who the site was marketed towards. 

These adults tend to trend older than book-social-media users. They are more likely to have kids and would like to more greatly engage with the library's different events, programs, and services. They are also looking to keep up to date with new releases but will rely more heavily on the events' features. As such, I crafted my user persona to be more focused on this lens, (while still keeping in mind how the site could suit both these userbases). 

*Developed Persona*

Elizabeth Banner is an aspiring author seeking community. She is especially tuned into library events and services like writer’s workshops, industry talks, and other potential resources she could use to help further her career. She is a Digital Native, she knows how to use technology, and as such, prefers cleaner, sleeker, more streamlined websites that allow integrations and/or prioritize efficiency. Elizabeth wants to keep up to date with the latest releases as well as further educate herself. 

*Market and User Research*

After identifying my user base I sought to better understand the site's core issues, both in relation to other peer websites on the market and from the user base's perspective. In this process, I narrowed down three major issues I thought the site faced: 

1. Outdated Design

The outdated design, while a trend with most public library systems, disadvantages them in regards to their target audience. Most users of the site — and as such within the target demographic — will have a preference for cleaner, modern designs as digital natives. 

It also puts them behind other MAJOR public library systems of their caliber, such as the New York Public Library which has a sleeker UI. A target user may be more inclined to explore other PA branches or even library systems outside of PA that offer out-of-state users opportunities (as well as commercial platforms). 

2. Feature Clutter

The FLoP website suffers from a significant amount of clutter. This is something present in the design but also in the organizational structure of the website itself. Users have so many options, many of which are presented at them all at once. 

For example, the blog page has a word cloud and a tag system attached that acts as a another content search method. However, the word cloud is largely useless and serves no real function and there are far too many tags for the feature to be useful. 

This is something we notice across the site, with there being lots of options present but many of which don't actually serve the user (i.e make things easier or simplified).  

This is also in contrast to other public library systems websites, like the NYPL, which has a much more streamlined approach.

Considering the target demographic is made up of digital natives, this excess of choice is likely to turn off the user as they are far more used to and inclined to use more organized websites. It also discourages users from exploring the site more, as well as actually looking into things they may be interested in since much of this information is buried behind tags, categories, and/or hidden in other pages. 

It would take Elizabeth, for example, significantly more work than necessary just to find a writer's workshop.

3. Lack Of Visual Hierarchy

Unlike most websites, the Free Library of Philadelphia does not arrange its content in order of importance or to draw attention to important/special features. Instead, the homepage, and subsequent pages, follow an inconsistent layout and design. Heading size, content layout, color palette, font color (etc) all range heavily depending on which area of the site you are on. 

The homepage is a prime example of this, with the content being placed all around the page, in varying styles, instead of section by section (or, more popularly, linearly). 

This is disadvantageous to both the user and the library. The target audience is less likely to be able to find the specific resources they are looking for, while the Library isn’t properly highlighting the resources/events/programs they intended to. 

And tailored my goals towards solving these issues in order to better serve the intended user base and highlight library services. 

*Site Map and Visual Identity Development*

With that in mind, I began to develop the site and its new identity. I wanted to emphasize a minimalist design, more in line with its peers, while also focusing on pushing forward my goals. 

I also began developing wireframes that reflected the developed identity. 

In this process, I underwent a round of user testing and feedback that pushed me to continue to reiterate upon the aesthetics of the to improve look and flow, reinforcing the established identity.

### every(): a habit tracker

#### i. Introduction 

Over the course of one term we were tasked with redesigning an app with a focus on improving the user's experience through micro-interactions. With instructor guidance, we rebranded, sketched, and developed a prototype user flow with unique interactions. 

I chose to redesign the android app Loop: Habit Tracker. 

#### ii. Design Process 

*Market Research and Rebranding*

I began first researching other popular habit tracker apps within the Google Play store. I wanted to see where Loop stood in comparison but I also wanted to see where users were finding issues with these apps as well. From this, I was able to develop a user persona:

With this user in mind, I began rebranding the app and developing a new interface that would address his pain points.

*Developing Microinteractions*

While the design, flow, and intended user base were important factors in this project, our primary focus was the creation and implementation of various micro-interactions throughout the app. How can we develop, iterate upon, and display our ideas? What interactions would bring the most user joy without causing frustration over time? Using my user persona, I drafted several microinteraction sketches that i thought could improve upon his pain points.

From there I developed an interaction flow, expounding upon these interactions and their greater function within the app.

I took these concepts into After Effects, where I began to animate out the user flow. 

#### iii. Conclusion

*Reflection*

Overall, I am happy with the micro-interactions themselves! I enjoyed the process of focusing specifically on this one aspect of design, as I have a vested interested in the little ways we can change a user's experience. Even just one small interaction can totally shift a user's perspective and I’d love to explore that more in future projects. I think my redesign of the app itself could definitely be improved upon, I think it leans a bit too far in the minimalist direction but I enjoy the result nonetheless.

### experiments in interface design


In IDM 211: User Experience Design I, students were given a model website (for an Architecture Firm) that we had to redesign according to a given prompt  For each prompt, we were given 1 week to redesign the site within the selected theme. We could not change the website's content, remove icons, or change the scope of the website. 

#### prompt i: graffiti


#### prompt ii: constructivism




## play

### campus activities board

As a graphic designer for Drexel’s Campus Activities Board, the largest student-run organization on campus, I develop branding and graphics for our events across various social media platforms. 

#### MURDER MYSTERY, *October 2023*
Developed for a Murder Mystery event with a focus on inmates being used in the cure for the zombie apocalypse. I wanted to invoke the aesthetic of old hidden documents, like the viewer is uncovering secrets past! I took inspiration from police documents and old anatomy diaries. 


#### HALLOWEEN NIGHTS @ EASTERN STATE, *October 2023*
Developed for a CAB-sponsored Eastern State Halloween night trip! For this poster, I wanted to emphasize the type more than anything, taking inspiration from graphic t-shirts. 

#### SIX FLAGS FRIGHT FEST, *September 2023*
Developed for a CAB-sponsored Six Flags Fright Fest trip! For this poster, I focused on trying to strike a balance between representing horror and rollercoasters. In my research both of the event and for inspiration, I made note of the lack of graphical attempts to combine the fun thrill of riding a rollercoaster with the added horror elements. I needed it to not just be a horror poster or a Six Flags poster, but something that struck the balance in between. I also wanted to play around with flatter, non-colored graphic styles. 

#### FLYERS V DEVILS, *September 2023*
Developed for a CAB-sponsored Flyers v Devils trip! While this event was canceled, I still enjoy the work conceptually! I wanted to really hone in on emulating the various interesting styles of sports graphics, particularly for the NBA while also leaning into a comic book aesthetic. 


### pop! poster series

Pop! Poster Series is an ongoing personal project of mine where I create posters for different pop culture media, characters, and artists I am interested in.
